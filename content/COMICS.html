            <p>The <abbr title="MCU">Marvel Cinematic Universe</abbr> is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by <i>Marvel Studios</i>. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by <i>Marvel Comics</i>. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</p>
            <section>
                <p>All in 2008, the first MCU tie-in comics to be published were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Iron Man: Fast Friends</li>
                    <li>The Incredible Hulk: The Fury Files</li>
                    <li>Nick Fury: Spies Like Us</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    They were followed by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An adaptation of Iron Man in 2010</li>
                    <li>Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron (2010)</li>
                    <li>Iron Man 2: Public Identity (2010)</li>
                    <li>Iron Man 2: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2010)</li>
                    <li>Captain America: First Vengeance (2011)</li>
                    <li>Captain America & Thor: Avengers (2011)</li>
                    <li>The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week (2012)</li>
                    <li>The Avengers Initiative (2012)</li>
                    <li>The Avengers Prelude: Black Widow Strikes (2012)</li>
                    <li>An adaptation of Iron Man 2 (2012)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Comic tie-ins for Marvel's television series began with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2014)</li>
                    <li>Jessica Jones (2015)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Marvel changed its approach to film tie-in material in 2012, retroactively dividing the tie-in comics into those that exist within the MCU continuity, and those that are merely inspired by the films and television series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, the following were divided into the former category:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Iron Man 3 Prelude (2013)</li>
                    <li>Thor: The Dark World Prelude (2013)</li>
                    <li>Captain America: The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic (2014)</li>
                    <li>Guardians of the Galaxy Infinite Comic (2014)</li>
                    <li>Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude (2014)</li>
                    <li>Avengers: Age of Ultron Prelude – This Scepter'd Isle (2015)</li>
                    <li>Ant-Man Prelude (2015)</li>
                    <li>Ant-Man – Scott Lang: Small Time (2015)</li>
                    <li>Captain America: Civil War Prelude Infinite Comic (2016)</li>
                    <li>Doctor Strange Prelude (2016)</li>

                    <li>Avengers: Infinity War Prelude (2018)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following titles served as film adaptations:</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>In 2008, Marvel released Iron Man: Fast Friends, a comic prequel to Iron Man, for which writer Paul Tobin was given a broad outline and some "temporal staging" so as to allow the comic to tie into the film. Later that year, The Incredible Hulk: Fury Files, which serves as a prequel to The Incredible Hulk, was released, detailing an encounter between the Hulk and Nick Fury, characters who had not yet been seen together in the MCU. Writer Frank Tieri noted that the tie-in comics "provide Marvel with the opportunity to do a lot of different things" that other media do not, including the exploration of non-superhero genres and the reintroduction of older characters.</p>
                <p>Alejandro Arbona, the Marvel editor tasked with overseeing the 2010 tie-in comics Iron Man 2: Public Identity and Iron Man 2: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., explained that Marvel "want to show readers more of that world, that connective tissue between all the movies, and a little bit more of how the characters interact", so the publishing side worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics and what to leave for the films, and how to "make these stories as strong as possible" from their experience making the films.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"The MCU [comics] are going to be stories set within movie continuity. [They are] not necessarily direct adaptations of the movies, but maybe something that happened off-screen and was mentioned in the movie...[Marvel Studios chief] Kevin Feige is involved with these and in some cases maybe the writers of the movies would be involved [as well.]"</p></blockquote>
                <p>—Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada outlining his plan for the MCU comic books in November 2010.</p>
                <p>For Marvel's The Avengers in 2012, Marvel's senior vice-president of sales David Gabriel described a "more focused" approach to tie-ins than previously, with the intention to reach fans of 'all walks of life'. This was echoed by Rich Thomas, global editorial director at Disney Publishing, who wanted the Avengers program to be "all things to all people. Just like the film, from the youngest reader...to the Marvel enthusiast."Since then, many of the tie-ins have had the red 'Avengers' stamp on the cover. Pilgrim, the creative director of research and development at Marvel Studios, confirmed that the previously released Public Identity, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and First Vengeance, were all official MCU stories, with the other previously released tie-in comics considered to be inspired by the MCU only.</p>
                <p>Comic writer Fred Van Lente stated in 2013 that he had proposed a regular comic series set within the MCU to Marvel, but they wished to keep all possibilities open for potential film and television development. He said that this was also the reason why Marvel does not want writers to introduce new elements to the MCU through tie-in comics. In March 2014, Pilgrim confirmed that the MCU Infinite Comics were officially canon. That July, the MCU tie-in comics expanded to television tie-ins with the release of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase, a comic inspired by the first season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In November, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso avoided a question of whether an ongoing comic series could be set within the MCU, but did note that Marvel Comics would "always be working on books set in the Cinematic Universe...the collected editions of those comics end up being some of the best sellers of the year".</p>
                <p>In February 2015, Pilgrim clarified that the canon tie-ins "are considered official MCU canon stories" set in the same universe as the films and television series, whereas the other, "inspired by" tie-ins are "more about having another fun adventure with the Avengers....where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form", but not affect the official MCU continuity.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        <q>When we started launching <i>Marvel Studio</i> and decided these movies were interconnected...we wanted to make sure it made sense as a cohesive, whole piece, [which] really sort of freed us up to start asking what other stories would we like to tell....anything that we really loved but didn't necessarily have a place in the film[s] is fair game.</q>
                    </p>

                    <li>An adaptation of Spider-Man: Homecoming</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In January 2015, Pilgrim explained the process for adapting films into tie-in comics, noting that scripts and other behind-the-scenes material are referenced in addition to the actual films. Because of this, the adaptations sometimes have new scenes, which Marvel "felt strongly enough" to include as canon, even though they were never filmed. Examples include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an interaction between Jasper Sitwell and Nick Fury in Iron Man: I Am Iron Man!</li>
                    <li>the "Boys Flight Out" sequence from Iron Man 2, where Tony Stark invites James Rhodes to wear the Iron Man Mark II armor</li>
                    <li>an interaction set during Captain America: Civil War between Peter Parker and his Aunt May in Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude</li>
