        The <abbr title="MCU">Marvel Cinematic Universe</abbr> is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by <em>Marvel Studios</em>. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original <em>Marvel Universe</em> in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) tie-in comic books are limited series or one-shot comics published by <em>Marvel Comics</em> that tie into the films and television series of the <em>MCU</em>. The comics are written and illustrated by a variety of individuals, and each one consists of 1 to 4 issues. They are intended to tell additional stories about existing characters, or to make connections between MCU projects, without necessarily expanding the universe or introducing new concepts or characters.
